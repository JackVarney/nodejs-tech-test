We would like you to develop a RESTful API using Node.js and Express with the ability to do the following:

- Get all the things
- Create a thing
- Get a specific thing

Here is the JSON schema for a thing:

```
{
    "id": "1b78c6b6-1818-11ea-8d71-362b9e155667",
    "dateCreated": "2019-12-06T11:03:28.200Z",
    "name": "Thing 1",
    "value": 10000
}
```
